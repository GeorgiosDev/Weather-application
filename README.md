# Weather-app
A weather forecast app made with node.js and uploaded to heroku. 

The user can enter a city name or a country name,combined with postal number to see the weather forecast.

This is a Javascript project with nodejs as a runtime enviroment. I used handlebars as template engine and mapbox API and weatherstack API to collect the data. 

There is also some informational templates about me and the project
